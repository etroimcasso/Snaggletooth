// The S-DSP — the sound chip the SPC700 drives through the DSPADDR/DSPDATA
// registers. This header carries the DSP's state as a value and the voice
// sample pipeline's pure mechanisms: BRR sample decode (turning a 9-byte
// compressed block into sixteen 15-bit samples), the sample-directory read,
// the per-voice BRR streaming interlock under a pitch counter, 4-point
// Gaussian interpolation over the stream's four most recent samples, the shared
// noise generator, the volume envelope, and the output stage — envelope
// application, per-voice volume, the eight-voice sum, master volume, and the
// mute gate, into a 32 kHz stereo frame.
//
// A BRR block is decoded exactly as the hardware does — the four integer
// filters, the shift-13..15 anomaly, and the clamp-to-16-then-clip-to-15
// sequence whose dirt-effect and lost-sign glitches are behaviors to
// reproduce, not to sanitize. The same exactness holds for interpolation: the
// Gaussian table is the hardware's ROM data, and the kernel keeps the
// hardware's partial overflow handling, documented wrap included.
//
// The output stage runs the hardware's mixer chain. Each voice's sample — its
// interpolated BRR output, or the shared noise level when the voice's NON bit
// is set — is scaled by the voice's 11-bit envelope into the internal
// -4000h..+3FFFh amplitude, then by its signed per-voice left/right volume, and
// the eight results are summed with a 16-bit clamp after every addition. The
// summed mix is then scaled by the signed master volume (MVOLL/MVOLR, a
// truncating multiply where the -128 product wraps), the echo unit's output is
// added through the echo volume (EVOLL/EVOLR), and, when FLG bit 6 is set, the
// frame is muted to silence — mute stops the emitted frame only; every voice, the
// noise generator, the envelopes and the echo unit keep advancing.
//
// The echo unit is a delay line in APU RAM: each sample it reads the oldest 4-byte
// entry of a ring buffer based at ESA*100h, runs a per-channel 8-tap FIR filter
// over the last eight entries, adds that output to the main mix through EVOL, and
// — unless FLG bit 5 disables echo writes — mixes the EON-enabled voices with the
// FIR output scaled by the echo feedback (EFB) and writes the result back over the
// entry it read. The buffer size is EDL<<9 entries (EDL zero gives a single-entry
// buffer); with writes disabled the buffer is a static loop that keeps feeding the
// filter. Echo samples are 15 bits stored left-justified in a 16-bit word, so a
// read arithmetic-shifts right one and a write clears bit 0.

// noise step, so those checks — and voices 1-7's in the following frame —
// read the advanced counter. The poll reads the pre-tick sample index, so the

void tickDspSample(DspState& dsp) noexcept;

// Generates one 32 kHz stereo output sample and advances the whole DSP by it.
// The order is the hardware's: poll KON/KOFF, then for each of the eight voices
// stream a sample, step its envelope, and fold its enveloped amplitude into the
// left/right sum through the per-voice volume; then scale the sum by the master
// volume, add the echo unit's FIR output through the echo volume, apply the mute
// gate, advance the shared noise generator, and tick the per-sample state.
//
// A voice in its post-key-on startup outputs silence and holds its envelope
// through the countdown; its stream already advances at the pitch from the
// countdown's second call on (the first performs only the start-address read),
// crossing whole sample positions while the fractional remainder is discarded,
// so the first sounding sample interpolates from index 0.
// Otherwise the voice's sample is its
// interpolated BRR output, or the shared noise level when its NON bit is set,
// and the enveloped amplitude is (sample * envelope) >> 11 — the internal
// -4000h..+3FFFh value that VxOUTX returns the high byte of and the next voice's
// PMON reads. When PMON is enabled for a voice (bits 1-7), its pitch step is
// scaled by the previous voice's amplitude; the step is not capped, but the
// counter's in-group position it is added to clamps at 7FFFh, which bounds the
// advance at four source samples per output sample and parks a position the
// clamp caught at the group's last fraction (advanceVoiceStream). Each
// channel adds (amplitude * VxVOL) >> 6 (the signed 8-bit volume with the
// BRR-dropped low bit recovered), and the sum is clamped to signed 16 bits after
// every addition. The summed mix is scaled by the signed master volume
// (sum * MVOL >> 7, truncated so the -128 product wraps); the echo output is added
// as (fir * EVOL) >> 7 with a 16-bit clamp; FLG bit 6 mutes the returned frame to
// silence while every internal mechanism keeps running.
//
// The two overloads differ only in whether the echo unit may write its buffer.
// The first takes writable RAM and runs the full unit, including the feedback
// write the echo delay line depends on. The second takes read-only RAM: the echo
// unit still reads, filters and contributes its output, but it cannot write, which
// is identical to holding FLG bit 5 set (echo writes disabled) — the buffer is a
// static loop. Callers that exercise the echo delay use the first; callers that
// only need the voice mix and never arm echo use the second.
